# 3D Noise Visualization With Marching Cube Algorithm

## Abstract
3D visualizations of different noises using the marching cubes algorithm. Those ones are animated by varying the iso-surface value with time. The final result can be watched on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/808352034).

## Introduction
As an art and image technology students, we are used to using 2D noise textures, especially in a realistic / organic artistic approach to represent the complexity of the world around us. After watching a video by Daniel Shiffman about the square marching algorithm, I was curious to represent these noises in a three dimensional space, images that I could not find, especially on the Internet. To achieve this goal, I combined the cube marching algorithm with the most commonly used noise algorithms (Perlin,Worley, Simplex), in a Processing programming context.
